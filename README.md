# office-network using cisco packet tracer
AIM: To create a simulation of a real-life network scenario using cisco packet tracer.

COMPONENTS USED:

	•	18 end devices (5 laptops,1 server,12 pcs)
	•	3 routers
	•	5 switches
	•	3 access point switches for wireless devices like laptops.

DESCRIPTION:

	•	This is a simulation of a computer network designed for an office.
	•	It comprises of various departments like Managing dept, HR dept, Production dept, Sales dept and Accounts dept.
	•	Each dept consists of a separate network of laptops and Pcs according to their requirements.
	•	All devices in a network are inter-connected to each other via switches.
	•	Two or more networks are connected to each other using routers.
	•	Wireless devices like Access-point are used to connect laptops/tablets to the network by adding the WPC300N module.
	•	Each router has an IP address which acts as a gateway for the device and each device in connection to the router via switches has an IP address corresponding to it.
	•	E.g., Router IP-126.168.1.1, device IP- 126.168.1.2
	•	We then ping different IP addresses to see the transmission of packets over the network.
	•	We then send messages across the network to see if they are transmitted and received.
	•	We then add a server and set up its IP configuration and DNS which is then configured by DHCP for all client devices.
	•	Then the emails are configured for respective devices.
	•	Sending and receiving of mails across various departments ensures the systematic working of the network.
